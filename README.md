# UFOs

## Module 11: Creating Dynamic Content with JAVASCRIPT
For this assignment, we created a custom webpage to organize UFO sightings data into a table which we can filter using different inputs.  In doing so we gained knowlegde in utilizing HTML to create the framework for our web page, Javascript as the primary code to build the webpage and CSS to add custom attributes to make it visually dynamic.

### Tools:
* HTML
* JAVASCRIPT
* CSS
* BOOTSTRAP

### Syntax
After getting somewhat familiar with Python, part of the challenge was learning how similar or different the syntax is for Javascript compared to Python.  Although the concepts were similar, some of the notable differences were as follows:
* Variables - were mostly camel-case as opposed to snake-case as in Python
* Case-sensitive - upper and lower case words are considered "different" in Javascript
* Semi-colons - needed to end statements
* Indention and curly-brackets - this was more emphasized in Javascript that in Python and could be considered one of the more tedious attributes of this language

### Inter-connected relationship between app.py, index.html and data.js
After a very confusing Module 10 about Web-Scraping, this module actually made sense of some of the things I did not comprehend in Module 10.  In some ways I think this module should have come before it as it better prepares us with how the app.py and index.html worked and connected with each other along with the style.css file as well. I also believe the "storyboarding" section of Module 11.2.4 contributed in furthering that understanding as far as placement of HTML elements in the framework by giving us a visual representation of what we being asked to create.

When the pieces all came together, the result is a very visually appealing webpage.

### Results of webpage
The input label to search by date worked fine.  The only limitation was that the data itself was limited to signtings from only a two-week period at most from January 1, 2010 to about mid-January of 2010.  The data was also limited as it only listed, for the most part, cities in the USA with a few exceptions in Canada.  

### Create additional filters
For the Challenge portion, we were asked to create additional input labels so we could filter via City, State, Country and Shape of the UFO.  Learning how to include, design, manipulate and plot different attributes and elements of this webpage was genuinely enjoyable - one of the highlights of this class!
